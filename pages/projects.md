### devola2 

A small audio-reactive visualizer desktop software. Developed specifically for B.L.M.D and Even Tide band visuals. And I'm continously implementing band's ideas into it.

B.L.M.D is an experimental musical collective from Mongolia that mixes different genres in their production (trip hop, rap, experimental rock, electronic), emphesizing the "dopeness" of the sound rather than a specific style. 

Even Tide is almost a sister band to B.L.M.D and shares most of its members. The difference is that it has a female lead singer and a deeper, melancholic theme.
