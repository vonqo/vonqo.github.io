### B.L.M.D and Even Tide visuals

_since: 06/2020_ `p5js` `three.js` `glsl` `electronjs`

B.L.M.D is an experimental musical collective from Mongolia that mixes different genres in their production (trip hop, rap, experimental rock, electronic), emphesizing the "dopeness" of the sound rather than a specific style. 

Even Tide is almost a sister band to B.L.M.D and shares most of its members. The difference is that it has a female lead singer and a deeper, melancholic theme.

I collaborated with B.L.M.D and Even Tide to create visuals for the concert in 2020. Since then I became a member of the group.

I developed a real-time audio visualizer app and continously implementing band's ideas into it.
