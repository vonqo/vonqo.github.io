Participated as the following artwork:

* **Echo** - Audio interactive installation `unity 3D` `cloudpoint` `arduino`

Curator’s USP 
“Every action we do has consequences, and the consequences and causes follow our actions like an echo.”  Enkh-Amar's interactive media installation “Echo” shows our interconnectedness and entanglement in the world, which we often cannot see in this direct way, and makes it tangible.
